This folder cointain two other foders, one ./lib with seven ruby programs and in the other ./spec it's the test files corresponding to each programs.
There are 7 test files, each of these files are about a ruby file. The first one exists (`lib/00_hello.rb`), the other do not exist yet (`01_temperature.rb`, etc). You will have to create them. But first let's work with the first program.
